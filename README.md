# WeatherDashboard
MSU - Homework 06: Weather Dashboard (Server-Side APIs)

For this project I created a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I retrieved weather data for cities from the OpenWeather API and used localStorage to store any persistent data.
